      With over ten years’ professional experience, my skills span pretty much
      every element of digital design, from UX/UI, to video editing for social
      media, to HTML/CSS, to graphic design and art direction. Not knowing how
      to do something isn’t a barrier – I’m a fast learner, and my knowledge has
      constantly evolved throughout my career.
